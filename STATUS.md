# Status

What runs, what does not, and what comes next. Counts are in `COVERAGE.md`
(`npm run coverage`), never here.

## What runs

A pure, deterministic, event-sourced rules engine for D&D 2024 (SRD 5.2.1),
with the SRD catalogue as a separate content package and the same door open
to homebrew.

- **Dice and rolls** — seeded, replayable, every roll with provenance; the
  D20 pipeline with named modifiers and attributed advantage; typed damage
  against per-type defences; criticals; reaction windows held open.
- **Creatures** — derived character sheets, stated monster sheets, all
  fifteen conditions with sources, hit points, temporary hit points, death
  saves, exhaustion.
- **Space** — a cube lattice, distance between volumes, declared sight and
  cover, six area shapes, persistent and carried areas, teleportation,
  mounting.
- **Combat and time** — Initiative, the action budget, joining a running
  fight, the clock, spans and turn-anchored deadlines, repeat saves and
  delayed damage raised by the boundary, payouts a casting makes at one,
  Short and Long Rests.
- **Casting** — slots and Pact slots as pools, castings with identities,
  Concentration, interruptible declared castings, long castings and rituals,
  reaction spells, ongoing records that later activations act through.
- **Spell execution** — the effect kinds and three rider kinds; the SRD
  spells the catalogue defines run end to end.
- **Characters** — all twelve SRD classes with their SRD subclass, all nine
  species and all four backgrounds, creation and advancement validated
  against the book, multiclassing, feats recorded and a few executed,
  features executed where a reader exists and honestly marked `manual`
  where not.
- **Content** — `createContent` / `loadContent` validate a catalogue from
  typed input or JSON; `SRD_CONTENT` is built through it; a homebrew spell or
  class using existing mechanics needs no engine change (`content.test.ts`).
  Languages and alignments are content too, so a world may declare its own
  tongues, its own alignment axis, or none.
- **Replay** — a scripted four-round fight and two frozen logs fold
  byte-identically.

## What does not

- No tool surface, orchestration, persistence or web app. The engine has no
  idea a language model exists, which is the point; the layer above it is
  the next milestone.
- Spells whose text needs a mechanic the engine lacks are *tracked* (cast,
  costed, timed, and the effect left to the table) rather than executed;
  `COVERAGE.md` lists which and names the missing shape.
- Most class features past the common shapes are `manual` with a note.
- Species and background traits past the shapes that already exist are
  `manual` with a note — Darkvision, breath weapons, ancestry tables,
  lineage spells. None of them is counted: `COVERAGE.md` audits class
  features only, so origin features are honest and invisible at once.
- Feats: the origin and fighting-style feats, recorded, two executed.
- Equipment stops at mundane items: no weight, attunement, magic items or
  ammunition spent. Objects that are not creatures are not modelled.
- Overriding printed content with homebrew of the same id is refused; only
  adding beside it is supported.

## Next

1. **The tool surface** (`@ie/tools`): the Zod-validated commands a DM or a
   model calls. Its session boundary is decided —
   `docs/design/claude-integration.md` — and `tools/llm-probe` already drives
   a live model through a smaller version of it, so this is promotion more
   than authorship.
2. **What `COVERAGE.md` does not count.** The report audits class features
   only, so nine species and four backgrounds of honestly-marked work is
   invisible to it, and the script reads the *built* `@ie/content` — a stale
   build reports on yesterday's catalogue without saying so.
3. **Content as files**: a loader in the app layer that reads homebrew JSON
   (and, later, a database) into `loadContent`.
4. **The next mechanical shapes** the coverage report ranks highest, each
   added to the engine with its resolver, validator rule and tests, then
   the spells that use it added as content. A grant that reads a sibling
   feature's choice through a content-declared table is not yet on that
   list and blocks four species on its own.
