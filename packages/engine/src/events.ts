 * any other route. That is what makes a campaign replayable, auditable — "show
 * me exactly why the goblin died" — and testable end to end.
 *
 * **Events carry resolved outcomes, not intents.** A die is rolled once, when
 * it is rolled, and the result is recorded forever. Replaying the log applies
 * those recorded numbers; it does not roll again. The alternative, replaying
 * intents through the rules, would mean every future rules fix silently
 * rewrote history and a campaign played last week resolved differently today.
 *
 * So randomness enters the log exactly once, at the point of the roll. From
 * there on the fold is a pure function of what is written down, and the seed
 * and generator state are recorded only so a *live* session can carry on
 * rolling where it left off.
