/**
 * Benefits a class feature grants for as long as its rule holds.
 *
 * These are not the bonuses a spell hangs on a creature, and the difference is
 * the whole design. A spell's bonus *starts* at a moment somebody can write
 * down — `bonus-applied`, linked to the casting that made it — and ends when
 * that casting does. An aura has no such moment: whether you are in one is a
 * fact about where two creatures are standing, and it changes every time
 * either of them moves, without anything happening that a log could record.
 *
 * So these are **derived from state on every read**, and nothing is ever
 * stored on the creature they reach. That is not an optimisation; it is the
 * only way a conditional benefit stays conditional. A stored copy would be an
 * unconditional bonus wearing a feature's name, and it would go wrong at
 * exactly the moment it mattered — the paladin walks away, the barbarian is
 * stunned — because nothing would have told it to.
 *
 * What the SRD asks for, feature by feature:
 *
 * | Feature | Reach | Condition |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Danger Sense | self | "unless you have the Incapacitated condition" |
 * | Aura of Protection | 10-foot Emanation | "inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition" |
 * | Aura of Courage | the same aura | — |
 * | Aura of Devotion | the same aura | — |
