 * otherwise acyclic value graph, and the kind of edge that turns into a cycle

 *
 * Retry-safety has two halves and only one of them is free. A pure command
 * gives identical events from identical state — but a caller retrying after
 * its batch was already applied is looking at *updated* state, where casting
 * again is a genuine second casting that spends a second slot and rolls a
 * second save. An id is what tells those two situations apart.
 *
 * The same id means the same command, and the engine holds callers to that:
 * the inputs are fingerprinted alongside the id, and reusing an id for
 * different work is refused rather than silently swallowed. A silent no-op
 * there would be the worst of both worlds — the second command never runs and
 * nobody is told.
